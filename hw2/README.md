#### Homework 2

**Assignment 1: 99 Bottles of Beer**
- Write a script that prints the lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" in the terminal. If you're unfamiliar with the song, you can [find the lyrics here](https://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/numbers/99bottlesofbeeronthewall.html). Do not worry about spelling out the numbers, use actual numbers (100, 99, 98...).
- Make sure your program can handle both singular and plural cases (i.e. both "100 bottles of beer" and "1 bottle of beer").



**Assignment 2: Random Address Generator**
- Write a script that can generate random addresses
- As a first step, create arrays that contain dummy data for each of the following: street number, street name, city name, state name and zip code
- Your script should randomly select one item from each of these arrays and then use them to construct a random address
- Each time you run the script, it should print a new randomly-generated address to the terminal. For example:
- `node random-address.js`
- `=> 34578 Dolphin Street, Wonka NY, 44506`
